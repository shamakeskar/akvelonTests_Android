groups.\n\nWhy LinkedIn for BlackBerry has not this feature, yet?\n\nI mean, Facebook has many other possibilities to connect with people and so on;for my personal use of that, I don't need so much to keep its groups in mobility (by the way, iPhones and Android can do that, so it was time RIM paired to them).\n\nBut with LinkedIn for BlackBerry you can just add people and accept requests, and the status feature I think it is not so used by people (for sure less than partecipating in groups).\n\nDon't you think that this lack is a very important failure from RIM, who is always so close to
