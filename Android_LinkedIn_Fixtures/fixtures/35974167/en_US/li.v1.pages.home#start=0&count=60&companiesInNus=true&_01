Registration is free, and all webinars are recorded.\n\nOptimizing Image Maps for Online and Printed Output | Oct 17, 10:00-11:00 am (Pacific Time)\n\nImage maps are great to put in online Help - but they don't work at all in PDF. Using both Flare and Capture, I'll show you how to build an image map, apply condition tags to callouts, and hide and show content to make your image look great in print outputs.\n\nPresenter: Laura Johnson, Certified Advanced Flare Developer and Trainer\n\nRegister: https://www.madcapsoftware.com/demos/signup.aspx?id=1134938198291879998 \n\nThe Power of Graphics: Getting the Best from Screenshots and Images in Flare | Nov 9, 10:00-11:00 am (Pacific Time)\n\nScreenshots and other images can really help to communicate complex information more effectively, and they play a significant role in making your documentation more attractive and engaging. However, poorly executed or positioned graphics can have the opposite effect, so it is critically important to master some basic skills for working with images. This webinar demonstrates the potential power of graphics and explains a range of techniques for ensuring that your images are optimized for both print and onscreen outputs.\n\nPresenter: Matthew Ellison, Certified Flare Trainer and Consultant\n\nRegister: https://www.madcapsoftware.com/demos/signup.aspx?id=1134981667585575076\n\nFor more information, including past recorded webinars, visit:\nhttp://www.madcapsoftware.com/resources/livewebinars.aspx","person":{"authToken":"name:1yvl","distance":100,"firstName":"David","formattedName":"David F.","headline":"Marketing Manager at MadCap Software, Inc.","id":"11135506","lastName":"F.","picture":"http://m3.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_80_80/p/3/000/056/35f/13971a2.jpg","hasPicture":true},"links":[{"type":"post","id":"g-118370-S-174414602"}],"like":0,"comment":0,"footer":{"picture":"http://m3.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_80_80/p/3/000/056/35f/13971a2.jpg","text":"David F. posted this"}},{"tType":"nut1","dtType":"dnut2","type":"nu","id":"UNIU-96538721-5662431184211177472-SHARE","timestamp":1350028797201,"header":"Some <script> Some very very very long name","picture":"http://m3.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_80_80/p/3/000/0cc/26a/381a76f.jpg","text":"Test news for test 35974167","like":0,"isLiked":false,"comment":0,"person":{"id":"96538721","firstName":"Some <script>","lastName":"Some very very very long name","headline":"set at eCharcha","authToken":"name:K1Qi","picture":"http://m3.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_80_80/p/3/000/0cc/26a/381a76f.jpg","formattedName":"Some <script> Some very very very long name"},"sendConnectionSubject":"I thought this was interesting...","sendConnectionBody":"Check out this update from Some <script> Some very very very long name:\n\nTest news for test 35974167\n\n--Some <script>","replyPrivateSubject":"Your update","replyPrivateBody":"\n--Some <script>\n\n-------------------\nTest news for test 35974167"},{"tType":"nut3","dtType":"dnut2","type":"nu","id":"UNIU-96538721-5662431152699359232-SHARE","timestamp":1350028789688,"header":"Some <script> Some very very very long name","picture":"http://m3.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_80_80/p/3/000/0cc/26a/381a76f.jpg","text":"http://lnkd.in/9Ct558","like":0,"isLiked":false,"comment":1,"shareId":"s1309468094","footer":{"picture":"http://m3.licdn.com/media-proxy/ext?w=80&h=100&hash=h6LL31v%2B%2B5nM4Zv9tZMdSE7Qqdg%3D&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F10%2Fdevice_3.png%3Fw%3D440%26h%3D330","text1":"Facebook's First Mobile Advertising Interface Was Built By An Intern","text2":"techcrunch.com"},"person":{"id":"96538721","firstName":"Some <script>","lastName":"Some very very very long name","headline":"set at eCharcha","authToken":"name:K1Qi","picture":"http://m3.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_80_80/p/3/000/0cc/26a/381a76f.jpg","formattedName":"Some <script> Some very very very long name"},"links":[{"type":"content","url":"http://lnkd.in/9Ct558","text1":"Facebook's First Mobile Advertising Interface Was Built By An Intern","text2":"http://techcrunch.com","picture":"http://m3.licdn.com/media-proxy/ext?w=80&h=100&hash=h6LL31v%2B%2B5nM4Zv9tZMdSE7Qqdg%3D&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F10%2Fdevice_3.png%3Fw%3D440%26h%3D330"}],"sendConnectionSubject":"I thought this was interesting...","sendConnectionBody":"Check out this update from Some <script> Some very very very long name:\n\nhttp://lnkd.in/9Ct558\nFacebook's First Mobile Advertising Interface Was Built By An Intern ( http://lnkd.in/9Ct558 from http://techcrunch.com )\n\n--Some <script>","replyPrivateSubject":"Your update","replyPrivateBody":"\n--Some <script>\n\n-------------------\nhttp://lnkd.in/9Ct558\nFacebook's First Mobile Advertising Interface Was Built By An Intern ( http://lnkd.in/9Ct558 from http://techcrunch.com )"},{"tType":"nut2","dtType":"dnut2","type":"topnews","id":"5662117539040223271","timestamp":1350028789688,"header":"techcrunch.com","picture":"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sgs3vsiphone5.png?w=440&h=330","text":"SoLoMo Update: Mobile-Only Social Networks To Reach 1B Users By 2014, 800M Users Of Foursquare + Other Location Services This Year","text2":"Crystal ball-gazing time from Gartner...
