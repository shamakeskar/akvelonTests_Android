Data warehousing simplicity is a surprisingly complex metric","text1":"Sexy statistics? Data warehousing simplicity is a surprisingly complex metric","text2":"Simplicity is sexy, as any familiarity with design best practice will show. The \"less is more\" imperative makes great sense on lots of levels, and it's the heart of IBM Netezza's longtime value proposition in the data warehouse market.\n\nHowever, simplicity--unlike speeds and feeds, another DW appliance differentiator--has no clear metric. How do you measure simplicity? Does it even make sense? If it makes sense, is it beside the point? Isn't simplicity in the eye of the beholder?\n\nThe other day, it occurred to me that we can measure simplicity of a DW appliance along three main dimensions. If you're a user evaluating a commercial DW appliance against your own current practice, or against a competing product, ask yourself the following:\n\n•\tThe \"fewers\": Does the appliance allow me to master its architecture, features, and tools in fewer days or hours? Does it require fewer setup, configuration, and migration steps? Does it take fewer hours to put into full production? Does it enable diagnosis and correction of problems in fewer minutes or seconds? Does it require fewer manual choices by architects, installers, and administrators? Does it have fewer requirements for manual tech support?\n•\tThe \"ones\": Does it come from one vendor? Is there one sales point of contact? Is it one SKU with one price and one maintenance plan? Can I acquire it through just just one purchase order? Is it shipped as one turnkey appliance with all requisite hardware and software components preconfigured and optimized? Can I set it up and configure it in just one session? Is there one technical support \"throat to choke\" for all issues? Is it manageable from the bare metal up through the database and other software through one well-designed console interface?\n•\tThe \"nones\": Is there no software installation? No indexes? No physical tuning? No hardware upgrade requirements? No failed drives that are not automatically regenerated? No bad sectors that are not automatically rewritten or relocated? No manual storage administration? And so forth.\n\nIn a sense, simplicity has many moving parts that must be integrated seamlessly for it all to hang together into a powerful platform. All of the quick-deploy quick-value benefits of appliances derive from the simplicity features that these metrics-- call them checklist items, if you will--embody.\n\nSee previous quick-hit on this topic here: https://www.facebook.com/NetezzaCorp/posts/10151922435070198?comment_id=33933301&offset=0&total_comments=1","person":{"authToken":"name:RRnd","distance":100,"firstName":"James","formattedName":"James K.","headline":"IBM Big Data Evangelist","id":"20637060","lastName":"K.","picture":"http://m3.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_80_80/p/2/000/0c7/3fa/390a7ad.jpg","hasPicture":true},"links":[{"type":"post","id":"g-35222-S-151355593"}],"like":0,"comment":0,"footer":{"picture":"http://m3.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_80_80/p/2/000/0c7/3fa/390a7ad.jpg","text":"James K. posted this"}},{"tType":"nut2","dtType":"dnut2","type":"topnews","id":"5644005071420149813","timestamp":1345723739961,"header":"forbes.com","picture":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/thumbnails/blog_27/pt_27_13527_o.jpg?t=1345559929","text":"10 Reasons Why Your Social Media Marketing Efforts Aren't Working--And What You Can Do About It","text2":"Red computer mouse (Photo credit: Wikipedia) If you’re frustrated with the results you’re getting from your social media marketing efforts, you are not alone.
